# UI Movie Description

How can we give to the user a description of the movie?

How to present it, in a way the user can read comfortably?

What is the proper effect?

## References

For the UI of every description, we can go for a minimal but clear presentation of the text, like the one used in [Resident Evil 7](https://gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=395#&gid=1&pid=4).

Each movie has a description and the body of the description is composed for:
    Title,
    Year,
    Sinopsis,
    Director.
